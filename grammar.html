        <h2>1. Master Complex Sentences</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it’s crucial:</strong> High-band IELTS responses demonstrate a range of sentence structures, especially complex and compound-complex sentences. They showcase your ability to express nuanced ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use subordinating conjunctions like <em>although</em>, <em>whereas</em>, <em>despite</em>, and <em>while</em>.</li>
            <li>Combine clauses to show relationships between ideas, e.g.: <em>“Although many people prefer cars for convenience, using public transport significantly reduces environmental impact.”</em></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>“Good grammar is credibility, especially on the Internet.” — Amanda Armstrong</blockquote>

        <h2>2. Advanced Tenses</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it’s crucial:</strong> Show a range of verb tenses, especially in Writing Task 1 and Speaking.</p>
        <p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn to describe trends using perfect and perfect continuous tenses:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>“The number of users has increased steadily over the past decade.”</em></li>
                <li><em>“The population had been growing until 2015 when it began to decline.”</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Use modal verbs to express probability or suggestions:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>“Governments should implement stricter policies to address climate change.”</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Varied Sentence Beginnings</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it’s crucial:</strong> Avoid repetitive sentence structures, which can sound monotonous and limit your score.</p>
        <p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start sentences with different elements:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Adverbs: <em>Interestingly, most people disagree with this view.</em></li>
                <li>Participial phrases: <em>Having completed the study, researchers concluded...</em></li>
                <li>Conjunctions or transitions: <em>Moreover, this approach is cost-effective.</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Precision in Prepositions</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it’s crucial:</strong> Misused prepositions are a common issue for IELTS candidates.</p>
        <p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Familiarize yourself with prepositions in common collocations, such as:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>“Interested in,” “capable of,” “concerned about.”</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Practice Writing Task 1 reports to perfect prepositions for graphs and maps, e.g.:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>“The number increased by 20%.”</em></li>
                <li><em>“The restaurant is located in the south of the city.”</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Vocabulary and Grammar Cohesion</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it’s crucial:</strong> Cohesion involves linking words (like <em>however</em>, <em>furthermore</em>) and grammatical patterns that tie ideas together.</p>
        <p><strong>How to practice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use cohesive devices effectively but sparingly. Overuse can lower clarity.</li>
            <li>Practice embedding relative clauses: <em>“The book, which was written in 1920, is still widely studied today.”</em></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>“Grammar is the system of human communication; mastery of it is a demonstration of mental agility.”</blockquote>
